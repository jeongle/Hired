# HIRED #

A better way to organize your job applications than a plain old spreadsheet
For fellow job-searchers such as myself!

## Summary ##
  > Hired is an application that will store the states of your job applications. It consists of a to do, in progress, and completed section that displays the job titles, companies, and more. Along with this information, Hired will keep track of your daily productivity, and provide metrics on how much activity you have spent weekly completing applications. There will also be some metrics to describe the distribution of your types of roles that you have applied for, or what types of roles you are hearing back the most. 

## Problem ##
  > Generic spreadsheets can get messy. It becomes easy to get lost in the plain text/table format, and it is often easy to add more details than necessary.

## Solution ##
  > Hired will abstract away all of these complications for you, and show you some beautiful graphs/plots powered by ChartJS so that you can refine and refactor your job search process.

## How to Get Started ##
  > If you haven't started applying yet, no worries! Hit the + button in any section of the main page and Hired will keep track of all your applications for you. If you already have started, it may take a bit of time to manually enter information, but it'll be useful for all the cool plots!

  > To access the plots, click on the graph symbol in the sidebar of the left page. Click on the paper symbol to return to the applications.

## Customer Satisfaction Guaranteed ##
